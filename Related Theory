Theory Explanation:
Checking String Lengths:

The first check ensures that the two strings have the same length. If they don't, they can't be isomorphic, so the function returns false.
Mapping Characters:

The function uses two unordered_map data structures (mp and mp1) to store the mappings between characters from string s to string b and vice versa.
mp maps each character of s to a corresponding character in b, and mp1 does the reverse: mapping each character of b to the corresponding character in s.
Iterating Through the Strings:

The function iterates through each character of the strings.
For each character in s, the function checks if it is already mapped to a different character in b using mp. If a mapping exists, it ensures the mapping is consistent.
Similarly, for each character in b, the function ensures that it maps consistently back to s using mp1.
Returning the Result:

If all character mappings are consistent between the two strings, the function returns true, meaning the strings are isomorphic. Otherwise, it returns false.
Space Complexity:
Auxiliary Space:

Two unordered_map data structures are used to store character mappings. Each map stores a maximum of n character mappings, where n is the length of the strings.
Hence, the auxiliary space complexity is O(n), where n is the length of the strings.
Final Space Complexity: O(n), where n is the length of the strings.

Time Complexity:
Iterating Through the Strings:

The function iterates over both strings once, which takes O(n) time, where n is the length of the strings.
Operations on unordered_map:

Each operation (insertion and lookup) in an unordered_map takes O(1) time on average.
So, each iteration of the loop takes O(1) time for checking and inserting into the maps.
Final Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the length of the strings.
Overall Complexity:
Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the length of the strings.
Space Complexity: O(n), where n is the length of the strings.
This solution efficiently checks if the two strings are isomorphic by using hash maps, ensuring both time and space complexities are linear with respect to the input size.
